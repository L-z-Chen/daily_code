# Astrojax Numerical Computing
> Before that, we have built the C# simulation program, which could be used to simulate the system. 
Now we want to find the solutions of some parameters wich could reach the stable horizonal trajectory.
We do have functions but it is hard to find the analytical solutions(maybe there is not analytical solution.), so we want to numerically find the soltion.
Some of these functions are hard to caculate its derivative, so we use **tensorflow** to handle it.

> And next, we might need reinfocement learning methd to dynamically find the solutions.
